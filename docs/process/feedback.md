# üîä Feedback 

## Kinds of Feedback

At Flexpa, we believe in the value of incorporating various feedback types, each serving distinct purposes that contribute to our continuous growth and improvement. We recognize and emphasize three essential categories of feedback: appreciation, coaching, and evaluation.

### Appreciation Feedback

* Expressing genuine gratitude, recognition, and encouragement.
* Fostering a positive atmosphere and reinforcing positive behaviors.

### Coaching Feedback

* Supporting professional development through insights and guidance.
* Empowering individuals to enhance skills and achieve aspirations.

### Evaluation Feedback

* Measuring performance against standards and expectations.
* Maintaining alignment with organizational goals for excellence.

## Giving Feedback

We believe that providing feedback regularly helps maintain and grow our culture of continuous improvement and open communication. 

All Flexpals are encouraged to give and receive feedback to promote personal and professional growth.

### Ask for Buy-In

* Ask if the person is open to receiving feedback before sharing your feedback: ‚ÄúAre you ready to hear some feedback?‚Äù

### Don‚Äôt Bottle It Up

* Avoiding honest criticism to protect feelings is actually harmful.
* When you withhold feedback to avoid an uncomfortable conversation, you are depriving someone of the chance to grow.

### Share Appreciation Often

* Appreciation satisfies a basic human need for recognition and connection.
* Appreciation motivates us to keep working hard and to improve our performance, as it reinforces our sense of value and contribution.

### Be Specific

* Broad appreciation can feel insincere. Broad evaluative or coaching feedback always begs for examples.
* Provide the potential impact of this feedback on others - whether it's regarding morale, quality of work, perception, etc.

### Share Fast

* Context and emotions are lost if feedback isn‚Äôt shared immediately

## Receiving Feedback

At Flexpa, we believe receiving feedback well is a skill that can help you learn, grow, and improve your performance in various domains of life. We also recognize that feedback can trigger negative emotions, defensive reactions, and distorted interpretations that hinder your ability to benefit from it. 

### Cultivate a Growth Identity

* Embrace a mindset of learning and change from feedback.
* Differentiate between coaching for improvement and evaluation for judgment.

### Separate Types of Feedback

* Recognize appreciation, coaching, and evaluation as distinct feedback categories.
* Understand their purposes and address specific needs.

### Understand Before Evaluating

* Comprehend feedback's origin, content, and direction.
* Listen, ask questions, and avoid assumptions.

### Shift to Difference Spotting

* Avoid immediate dismissal or argument.
* Analyze differences in data, interpretations, and values.

### Manage Emotional Responses

* Be prepared, mindful, and assertive.
* Separate emotions from feedback and express needs.

### Problem-Solving for Possibilities

* Transform feedback disputes into exploration.
* Generate options addressing underlying interests.

### Implement Feedback Effectively

* Prioritize actionable feedback relevant to goals.
* Experiment and track progress for continuous improvement.

### Decide What to Do with the You‚Äôre Given

* Receiving feedback well doesn't mean you always have to take the feedback.
* Receiving feedback means engaging in the conversation skillfully and making thoughtful choices about using the information and what you're learning.
