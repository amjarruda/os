# ðŸ›¬ Onboarding

## Welcome

We are so excited youâ€™re here and look forward to working together successfully.

This is an onboarding checklist for you to follow (and for the people you're working with to prepare for).

### Getting started

* Once you accept your offer, let us know your mailing address. Weâ€™ll be sending you your computer the week before your official start date.
* Sign your offer letter & employment agreements
* Confirm receipt of your laptop
* Complete Gusto or Humi registration (Gusto if you are in the US, Humi if you are in Canada)

!!! warning "Spearphishing"
    Don't be surprised if you encounter a [**spear phishing**](https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/phishing/spear-phishing/) attempt during your first few weeks. New employees are an easy target for cybercriminals so be sure to pay close attention to **Vanta's cybersecurity training**. Mark these emails as **unsafe** & forward them to the CTO for further evaluation.

### Week 1 Goals

#### Operations

* [**Gain access to all systems necessary**](../it/software.md) for your role including your @flexpa.com account
* Set up direct deposit on Gusto or Humi
* Read our [**operating system**](https://os.flexpa.com/)
* Add the [**Flexpa calendar**](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=c\_o2len2pmo8g0jk1ug3mq63fdq4%40group.calendar.google.com\&ctz=America%2FLos\_Angeles) to your Google Calendar, where we post important events
* Complete your infosec onboarding (youâ€™ll be emailed a link from Vanta to do so)

#### Process

* Participate in the weekly rituals (weâ€™ve sent you invites)
* Post your first [standup](./standups.md) and repeat this practice every morning in #standup
* If you're new to GitHub, complete the [Introduction to GitHub](https://github.com/skills/introduction-to-github) and [Communicate using Markdown](https://github.com/skills/communicate-using-markdown) skill development courses. GitHub and Markdown are used extensively at Flexpa and you need to be familiar with them even if you aren't on the product development team.

#### People

* Introduce yourself on Slack
* Meet the team as a group and individually 1:1

#### Product

* Ship a first pull request (no matter how small!)
* Listen to a recent sales engineering call we've recorded (aka a sales call)
* Listen to a recent solutions engineering call we've recorded (aka a support call)

### Week 2 Goals

* Communicate your 30 / 60 / 90 day plan to the group @ EOW ritual

### Beyond

Really, anyone who joins a new group successfully goes through an evolution that looks like: becoming knowledgeable, becoming productive, and becoming indispensable - meaning that you would be missed if you left! Everything you do beyond this point should target going through this evolution in your first 3 months.
