# GTM Roles

**BDR:** (Business Development Representative): A BDR’s responsibilities include lead generation, lead qualification / disqualification, outreach, follow up, and appointment setting.

**AE:** (Account Executive): An AE is primarily responsible for closing deals with qualified leads, including ensuring important documents like Service Agreements are surfaced and signed in a timely manner. They handle the later stages of the sales cycle and manage customer relationships. 

**Sales Engineer:** Sales engineers operate at the intersection of business, sales, and technology. Their responsibilities include demoing, solution design based off customer needs, and pre-sales support.

**Solutions Engineer:** Solutions Engineers work closely with the sales team to support the sales process by providing technical expertise and solutions to potential customers, create proof-of-concept implementations to showcase how the solution can specifically address the customer's requirements and help the customer troubleshoot during their implementation.

**Sales Operations Lead:** Key responsibilities include sales forecasting, pipeline analysis, sales KPI management and optimization, management of sales tech stack, legal sales doc drafting and compliance.


# BANT

BANT is an acronym that stands for "Budget, Authority, Need, Timing." It provides a simple framework for qualifying prospects in a business-to-business (B2B) sales setting. In order for a prospect to be qualified, each of the following 4 elements must be established:

**Budget** - Does the understand how pricing works at Flexpa, and have sufficient budget to pay for their intended usage?

**Authority** - Who is responsible at the prospect for deciding whether to go ahead with using Flexpa? Sometimes this is multiple people (ex: CPO and CTO)

**Need** - What is the prospect planning to use Flexpa for? Will Flexpa be able to help them with this use case? 

**Timeline** - If Budget, Authority and Need were met, when would the prospect be planning to go live with Flexpa?


# Stages of the Funnel


## Stage 1 - Qualifying (BDR)

This is from the first contact with the company (by email, calendared zoom call, etc) through to hand off to the Sales Engineer,



1. _What does the first contact look like?_
    1. _This can occur in many forms, (cold inbound, warm intro, response to a Flexpa sales email, etc.) but the key point is that the prospect indicates an interest in learning more about Flexpa. Regardless of source, BDR should move to have Zoom call with prospect ASAP._
2. _What does engagement with the prospect look like during this stage?_ 
    1. _Preference for synchronous objection handling / N discovery (Zoom calls)_
    2. _Option for asynchronous objection handling / N discovery (email)_
3. _What questions need to be answered before handoff to the Sales Engineer?_
    1. _Firm conviction that there is BA_T. Should be reasonably confident that N exists, but since often prospects have to ask multiple, detailed follow up questions about the product, it’s ok if the BDR passes off the lead to the Sales Engineer and still needs the Sales Engineer to fully establish N. This can also be discussed on Thursdays in the recurring call between BDR and Sales Engineer where they work through and discuss handoff._
4. _When does a BDR DQ rather than advance a prospect to the Sales Engineer?_
    1. _When any of B, A, N or T does not exist. If N isn’t fully clear yet, still ok to advance to Sales Engineer._
5. _What does a handoff look like?_
    1. _Email from BDR cc’ing in the Sales Engineer, and BDR then moves the deal card from Qualifying to Engaging_
6. _When does a Sales Engineer have to be on the BDR call?_
    1. _Use case that is promising but unclear_
    2. _Large / Very technical audience_


## Stage 2 - Engaging (Sales Engineer)

This is from first communications by the Sales Engineer (usually via email) through to the Sales Engineer handing off the prospect to the Solutions Engineer (and making the intro via email - see copy below).



1. _What does engagement with the prospect look like during this stage?_
    1. _Preference for asynchronous objection handling / N discovery (email)_
    2. _Option for synchronous objection handling / N discovery (Zoom calls)_
2. _What questions need to be answered and what does the prospect need to have in place before handoff to Solutions Engineer?_
    1. _BANT confirmed_
    2. _Existing or new use case clearly identified_
    3. _Clear understanding of where Flexpa will be embedded within workflow_
    4. _Technical team member(s) identified for kickoff_
3. _What does a handoff look like?_
    1. _Email introing Solutions Engineer_
4. _If an inbound prospect goes straight to testing without any other contact with a Flexpal, does this deal automatically fall into this stage_
    1. _No, the BDR still has to establish BANT_


## Stage 3 - Developing (Solutions Engineer)

This is from Sales Engineer’s email intro through to prospect completing full testing flow (defined as successfully integrating with Flexpa and making first API call) 



1. _What are the roles and responsibilities of the Solutions Engineer? To answer the “how”. This entails:_
    1. _Ensure prospect creates a workspace (if they haven’t yet)_
    2. _Ensure prospect has test mode usage_
    3. _Confirm go-live date_
    4. _Answer all questions (synchronously and asynchronously) and resolve all issues stopping prospect from having test mode usage and being ready to begin live billable events_
2. _What does engagement with the prospect look like during this stage?_
    1. _Synchronous guidance towards successful test mode usage (Zoom calls)_
    2. _Asynchronous guidance towards successful test mode usage (email and Slack)_
3. _Does the request to go live get submitted during this stage?_
    1. _If possible, yes, if there are details of the agreement that still need to be discussed, AE is able to assist._
4. _What does Handoff Look Like?_
    1. _Solutions Engineer informs AE that the prospect is finished testing and ready to go live._
5. _If an inbound prospect goes straight to testing without any other contact with a Flexpal, does this deal automatically fall into this stage?_
    1. _No, the deal stays in the qualifying stage until BANT is established._


## Stage 4 - Closed Won (AE)

This is once the first live mode request occurs.

1. _What does engagement with the prospect look like during this stage?_
    1. _Synchronous guidance towards successful test mode usage (Zoom calls)_
    2. _Asynchronous guidance towards successful test mode usage (email)_

2. _What are the roles and responsibilities of the AE at this stage?_
    1. _ID the authorized signatory_
    2. _Ensure prospect completes Live Mode Access Form submission (if they haven’t already done so) and is approved for live mode_
    3. _Obtain signature of Service Agreement_
    4. _Obtain signature of BAA (where necessary)_
    5. _Set proper pricing and necessary billing details within Stripe_

3. _When do they advance to stage 5_
    1. _After more than 10 billable events have occurred_

## Stage 5: Success and Support (Customer Success and Support)

This is from the first live pull onwards. Goals are to keep them actively using, increase usage, and resolve all bugs that get in the way of usage.
