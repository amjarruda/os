# ðŸŒ  Mission

The future belongs to those who show up. We're showing up for a future where you can actually own your health data in the way you own the rest of your digital life (_it is_ _yours after all)_.

Every _actually_ _good_ idea isnâ€™t going to sound particularly believable. Part of it being an _actually good_ idea is that itâ€™s uncommonly believed. Most of our sense of believability is based on assumption of stability â€” not where things could change.

Flexpa is dedicated to working on healthcare problems in a future that is messy and complicated and needs to bend to patients and people. We're on a mission to refactor healthcare by making it easy for users to share claims data with any application they want to in seconds. Weâ€™ve built the fastest, simplest, HIPAA-compliant method for accessing identified claims data from anyone.
